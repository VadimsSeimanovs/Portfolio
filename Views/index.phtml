                    Android development gave me much more then learning Java programming language but also gave me experience of using Android Studio and demonstrate the use of emulators. One of the ways to test the stuff that I have done is through the use of emulators which was a new experience to me.

                One of my biggest achievements was when me and the team that I was a part of went to Hack Manchester. Hack Manchester is a competition between other teams to create something that meets clients requirements. There were several clients to pick from which gave us wide options and ideas on the project that we would like to do. We chose to make a system that will run on the background of childs computer and detect any bad behavior that they are preforming while socilising through social media or any other part os the internet. The data will be then sent to the webpage which parents will have the admin permissions and allow them to minot what they have been involved in.
